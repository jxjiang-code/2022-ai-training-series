 I view AI as an intelligent method to obtain important information from limited data. For example, we use analytical method of numerical fitting to 
 get physical parameters from experiments. However, usually we cannot get enough information and need to assume some models. With nueral network, it
 is possible for a machine to define suitable models from experimental data. In case of non-inverse problems, we can provide training data with lots of 
 forward simulation and use NN to do the inversion. Wideband coherent X-ray diffraction imaging is such a technique that is promissing to get high 
 resolution X-ray images of nanomaterials, but suffering from spectral smearing. The smearing is predictable with the knowledge of X-ray spectrum. 
 The data will be physics based forward calculations and experimental data. We will start with convolutional neural network and find more suitable models
 that are more naturally close to the real imaging processing. The figure of merit metrics are similarities of the inversed real space image and the 
 ground truth test image.
